## Contributing to RET

Contributions are welcomed via [pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/rocmsys/RET/pulls). 
To avoid redundant work, please create an issue first and demand the assignment to yourself.

While opening an issue you need to choose between two categories:
1. **Feature request**: You want to propose a new feature and implement it.
    - Describe your intended feature and discuss the design and implementation.
2. **Bug report**: You want to implement a feature or bug-fix for an issue
    - Make sure your changes are consistent with the guidelines and follow the RET coding style.
    
Once you finish implementing a feature or bug-fix, please send a Pull Request to https://github.com/rocmsys/RET

### Proposed development workflow

2. Make changes to the source code
3. Review your source code changes before commit
